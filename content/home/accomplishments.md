  description: 'The J.J. Archambault Eastern Canada Merit Award recognizes exceptional IEEE volunteers for their meritorious service at the local Section and Area level within Eastern Canada. Established in 1991, it is one of IEEE region seventh key geographical unit service awards. The award is named in honor of Jean-Jacques Archambault (1919–2001), a pioneering Quebec engineer celebrated for inventing the world’s first 735 kV electric transmission line. Commissioned in 1965, this technological feat was so groundbreaking that it was later acknowledged by the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec as Quebec’s foremost technology of the 20th century.'
