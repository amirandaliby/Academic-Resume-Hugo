"ELK Stack" (Elasticsearch / Logstash / Kibana) or the "Elastic Stack"Elasticsearch is a powerful tool not only for powering search on big websites, but also for analyzing big data sets in a matter of milliseconds! It's an increasingly popular technology, and a valuable skill to have. 
This course covers cover setting up search indices on an Elasticsearch 7 cluster, and querying that data in many different ways. Fuzzy searches, partial matches, search-as-you-type, pagination, sorting along with hands-on examples.

It also explores what's new in Elasticsearch 7 - including index lifecycle management and the deprecation of types and type mappings with more depth on managing security with the Elastic Stack, and how backpressure works with Beats. Besides, importing data into an Elasticsearch index via raw RESTful queries, scripts using Elasticsearch API's, and integration with other "big data" systems like Spark and Kafka are all covered.

Furthermore, aggregation capabilities for structured data and data analysis using Elasticsearch as well as visualizations using the Elastic Stack's web UI, Kibana and Kibana Lens is explained in detail.

Lastly, it teaches how to manage operations on your Elastic Stack, using X-Pack to monitor your cluster's health, and how to perform operational tasks like scaling up your cluster, and doing rolling restarts.
