This course was all about how to use Docker, compose and Kubernetes on your machine for better software building and testing, gain the skills to build development environments with your code running in containers and build Swarm and Kubernetes clusters for server deployments!
It also has hand's-on with practices for making Dockerfiles and Compose files, build and publish your own custom images, and to create your own custom image registry to store your apps and deploy in corporate environments. Upon completion of this course I learnt:
   * Use Docker in your daily developer and/or sysadmin roles
   * Deploy apps to Kubernetes
   * Make Dockerfiles and Compose files
   * Build multi-node Swarm clusters and deploying H/A containers
   * Make Kubernetes YAML manifests and deploy using infrastructure-as-code methods
   * Build a workflow of using Docker in dev, then test/CI, then production with YAML  
   * Protect your keys, TLS certificates, and passwords with encrypted secrets
   * Keep your Dockerfiles and images small, efficient, and fast
   * Run apps in Docker, Swarm, and Kubernetes and understand the pros/cons of each
   * Develop locally while your code runs in a container
   * Protect important persistent data in volumes and bind mounts
